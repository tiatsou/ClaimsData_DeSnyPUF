# ClaimsData_DeSnyPUF
Analyzing outpatient claims data to find out the high utilizers and the economic impact.

### Background
Datasets used in this project are DE-SynPuf and are retrived from National Rural Health Resource Center. The Data Entrepreneursâ€™ Synthetic Public Use File (DE-SynPUF) is a set of realistic claims data from 2008 through 2010 made available by CMS(Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services). And the project followed the tutorial mentioned in this [website](https://www.ruralcenter.org/population-health-toolkit/data/using-claims-data).

- Data: 
1. DE1_0_2008_Beneficiary_Summary_File_Sample_1
2. DE1_0_2008_to_2010_Outpatient_Claims_Sample_1

- Goal: 
Find relationship between outpatient medicare reimbursement and the beneficiaries' chronic condition
  - relationshp between Number of Claims and outpatient medicare reimbursement annual amount
  - how to difine super utilizer
 
### Steps Applied
1. import *Beneficiary* and *Outpatient* data from CVS and change the data type
2. create new factor column *Year* based on the *CLM_THRU_DT* variable in *Outpatient* data
3. create new numeric column *NumerOfClaims* by counting the number of outpatient claim from *Outpatient* data for each beneficiary ID in *Beneficiary* data
4. use pivot table to find the summary statistics for the cleaned data

5. plot scatter plot to show the relationship between number of claims and annual medicare reimbursement amount 
   - based on the scatter plot, the more claims tend to have higher reimbursement amount

6. use pivot table to find how to define the high utilizers
   - the max number of claims is 33 while the 99% of beneficiaries claims less than 14
   - beneficiaries with more than 14 cliams will be assigned as high utilizers

7. create new binary colum *SuperUtilizer* based on the findings in step 6
8. use pivot table to find the common chronic condition among the high utilizer
   - about 89% of the high utilizers have diabetes

### Conclusion and Recommondation
- more cliams filed by a beneficiary tend to have more medicare reimbursement with 0.39 R Square
- the super utilizer is defined by beneficairies who filed more than 14 claims
- there is a high population(89%) in High Utilizers have diabetes
- the hospital can provide additional information about appropriateness of medical services and how to reach out to the primary healthcare providers. 
- whether the High Utilizer use the outpatient service appropriately in our case needs further analysis
